# Rotten Tomatoes Dataset Project

## Intro

This project presents an independent, end-to-end data visualization and analytics study using the **Rotten Tomatoes dataset** combined with **Top 1000 Grossing Hollywood Movies** data. The goal of the project is to examine how film success can be defined and measured through multiple lenses, including **financial performance**, **critical and audience reception**, and **actor collaboration networks**.

Using a combination of **interactive Tableau visualizations**, **Python-based analytics**, and **network analysis in Gephi**, this project explores how genre dominance, ratings, return on investment (ROI), and franchise-driven collaboration structures shape the modern film industry.

## Project Objective

This analysis conducts an independent exploration of a real-world dataset using the visualization and analytics techniques learned throughout the course. The project emphasizes:

- Interactive, high-quality visual storytelling  
- Multivariate analytics (ROI, score comparison, genre aggregation)  
- Graph analytics and network visualization  
- Clear narrative connection between visuals and findings  

---

## Research Questions

This project is guided by the following core questions:

- Which movie genres generate the most worldwide revenue?
- How do domestic and international box office sales differ by genre?
- Do audience and critic ratings generally agree?
- Does higher critical or audience approval lead to higher profitability (ROI)?
- Are some genres more financially successful than they are critically successful?
- How do actor collaboration patterns relate to genre dominance and franchise power?

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on a merged dataset created from two Kaggle sources:

- **Rotten Tomatoes Dataset**
- **Top 1000 Grossing Hollywood Movies Dataset**

The datasets were joined using a **composite key of movie title and release year**, resulting in **318 unique films** and over **3,000 actors**.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Tableau**
- **Python**
- **Pandas/Matplotlib**
- **Gephi**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PowerPoint**

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a film industry increasingly dominated by **franchise-driven ecosystems** rather than standalone critical successes. Genres tied to recurring casts and global spectacle outperform others financially, even when critical reception is mixed.
